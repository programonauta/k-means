# k-means
Implementation of k-means clustering

For now, just compile main.cpp file
```
g++ main.cpp -o main
```

To run
 
```
./main
```

The points are read from input.txt file, where each line must have one point with x and y values separated by spaces.

In this version, the number of centroid is hardcoded in two, and the first two centroids are not randomly chosen, but the first two.
